                            <p>The area at the foot of the Colorado Rocky Mountains between Fort Collins, Boulder, and Denver is often referred to as the &ldquo;Denver Beer Triangle&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Napa Valley of Beer&rdquo; and is home to notable craft breweries such as New Belgium, Left Hand, Odell, Avery, Great Divide, and the largest brewery in the world, Coors. As of May 2012, Colorado has 139 craft breweries with 75 more planned and ranks third in breweries per capita by state (Source: Colorado Brewers Guild). The Great American Beer Festival happens every fall in the Denver area and the Colorado Brewer's Festival has happened every summer for 23 years in Fort Collins.</p>

                            <p>It's no wonder that the popularity of homebrewing is on the rise with the influence of such craft beer traditions in this area. According to a survey conducted by the American Homebrewer's Association (AHA) in 2011, the nation's homebrew supply stores revenue was $306 million, up 24% from the year before, with 82% reporting an increase in the sale of beginner kits. Judging from the state-by-state membership totals of the AHA, more homebrewers live in Colorado than any other state (Source: Denver Post).</p>

                            <h3>Purpose</h3>

                            <p>To be a single resource for the craft beer hobbyist. It will provide information on how to get started, procedures, equipment, beer styles, and beer history that can even benefit homebrewers beyond the local area. Information on local supply stores, homebrew clubs, competitions, festivals, and brewery tours will be available for anyone interested in getting involved with the hobby locally. The site will also function as a place where the community of homebrew enthusiasts can gather to share recipes, recommendations, and proven techniques.</p>

                            <p>This site aims to function as an encompassing resource of information for homebrew hobbyists and craft beer enthusiasts in Colorado that is currently only available through several disparate and poorly designed sites.</p>

                            <p>A non-exhaustive list of existing sites at the time of this research include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="http://www.fermentedlychallenged.com/" target="_blank">Fermentedly Challenged</a></li>

                                <li><a href="http://coloradohomebrew.com/" target="_blank">Colorado Homebrew</a></li>

                                <li><a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/" target="_blank">Homebrew Talk</a></li>

                        <div class="projectAudience">
                            <h3>Audience</h3>

                            <p>The type of people that would be interested in this information ranges from the veteran homebrewer that constantly has something fermenting to the person that has never experienced a sip of a malt beverage but is interested in the opportunity to be a part of how it's made. Homebrewing has traditionally been a middle-aged, male­‐dominated pastime, but the 2011 survey by the AHA has indicated that people under 30 and women have increasingly been taking up the hobby since 2005.</p>

                                <p>I first started to develop the site by brainstorming the features that should be included and then narrowing those down into site areas which will inform the structure and navigation.</p>

                                <p>The initial exploration of concepts focuses on the home page and the features it could include. The numbering system indicates where the different features are placed on the page.</p>

                                <p>I then took the three concepts from the thumbnails that I thought worked best and developed the concepts further to a sample of the interior pages. The three I picked are indicated by the letters A, B and C on the thumbnail sketches.</p>
